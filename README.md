In terms of engineering requirements, your code will undergo review. Here's a couple of tips.

-   Make sure all ESLint linters pass. (`npm run lint`)
-   Use the "Prettier" software to adhere to code formatting standards.
-   Use TailwindCSS utility classes rather than bare CSS, unless absolutely necessary.
-   Turn in the CLA alongside the pull request.
